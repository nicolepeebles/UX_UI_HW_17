            <h1>Hi, I' Nicole!</h1>
            <p>Nicole Peebles graduated from Wade College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Merchandising & Design in 2015. She continued her retail career for 5 more years working as a visual merchandiser and store manager. Growing tired of retail and wanted to get back into a more creative role she started looking for a new career path. Wanting to continue to help people through experience she found UX and UI design.
                Enrolling in the bootcamp at UT Austin in July of 2020 she was challenged but developed new skills and knowledge in the following 6 months.
                
                Now Nicole is ready to help people through design by creating impactful and enjoyable experiences. She has new skills in user research, prototyping (Figma, Adobe XD), user testing and more.
